This project was to build an item traching program for Corner Grocer.
I feel that getting the program to function was what I did well here, along with using more best practice things throughout my coding
I believe that I could enhance my code by using more documentation and building psuedocode more to how I want the program to run.
The most challenging peice of code to write would be the grocer item header to link back correctly, I will be adding Github along with others to my support network.
I think that everything else we learned during the course helped build to this project and we used everything we learned to build it.
This program is simple and documented, updating the txt file would make it adaptible for different items. The menu would be easily changed as well.
